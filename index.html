    <h1>Project Team #21: Trend of Programming Language, COSI 116A F24</h1>

    <p><strong>Zixuan Liu</strong>, <strong>Yuanshuo Wu</strong>, <strong>Zhuocheng Wu</strong></p>

    <p>Project-long Course Project as part of COSI 116A: Information Visualization</a>, taught by <a href="https://cs.brandeis.edu/~dylan/">Prof. Dylan Cashman</a>, <a href="https://cs.brandeis.edu/">Brandeis University</a>.</p>


    <h1>Motivation</h1>

    <p><em>This project aims to analyze changes in the software market by examining trends in the most popular programming languages. We included comparisons of different languages tutorial search rate during times. Performance comparisons across various algorithms and tasks, focusing on runtime and memory usage. In addition, we compared usage rates across different regions, aiming to uncover how cultural, educational, or economic factors might influence language preferences. Through these visualizations, we hope to help newcomers make more informed decisions when selecting the “best” or “most popular” programming language as a starting point, while also offering experienced professionals insights into broader market trends and future directions.</em></p>

    <p><em>The rapid evolution of programming languages presents challenges for developers, educators, and organizations in making informed decisions about which languages to learn, teach, or adopt. While some languages gain widespread popularity due to advancements in frameworks or industry adoption, others decline or remain niche. There are many different programming languages, each with its own syntax, features, and typical use cases. Some languages may excel in system-level programming, while others thrive in data analysis, artificial intelligence, or web development. When a particular language is widely adopted in a certain field, it often reflects the direction of research, the pace of technological advancement, or even the strength of related job markets. By understanding these dynamics, both aspiring and seasoned developers can better align their skill sets with emerging opportunities and evolving industry demands. </em></p>


    <h1>Visualization</h1>

    <p><em>Below are the three interactive visualizations we have implemented. Static example follows.</em></p>

    <h1>Visualization explanation</h1>

    <!--<p><em>Final visualization screenshots (PNG images), design justifications, UI walk-through, and linked presentation slides.</em></p>-->

    <p><em>Our project focuses on creating an interactive data visualisation system that integrates a table, map, line chart, and scatter plot to provide insights into the popularity of different programming languages.
      The <strong>Barchat</strong> at the top show the trend on the popularity languages by Analysis the times a language tutorial is serached. User can move the slider below the barchart to
      see the data at a specific time. Since the focus here is on analyzing trends, a bar chart was used because its advantages on clear visual comparison and it also shows the growth or decline of a language from 2004
      .</em></p>


      <img src="/images/staticBar1.png" alt="barchartStatic" width="800" height="600">
      <img src="/images/staticBar2.png" alt="barchartStatic" width="800" height="600">
      <p><em>You can select a specific time by dragging the slider below the bar chart, which will update the chart to display data from that particular point in time. You can also click the play button to have the bar chart advance automatically month by month from the current position, and pause at any time to make adjustments. </em></p>
      <img src="/images/staticBar3.png" alt="barchartStatic" width="800" height="600">
      <p><em>When you brush on the bar chart, the table below will highlight the selected languages. The table is sorted based on data from 2004, allowing you to compare the current popularity of these languages with their 2004 levels of popularity. </em></p>

    <p><em>
      The <strong>World map</strong> displays countries colored based on data availability. When a user clicks on a country, the bar chart below updates to show the percentage of developers in that region using different programming languages. When hovering over a bar, the map dynamically displays a heatmap that represents the popularity of the corresponding programming language across different regions. The interactive nature of the map and charts allows users to explore the data for each region, offering insights into global programming language trends.</em></p>

      <img src="/images/staticMap2.png" alt="mapStatic" width="800" height="600">

      <p><em>The third visualization integrates a <strong>Scatterplot</strong> and a table to provide an interactive exploration of programming language trends. The scatterplot visualizes the relationship between runtime and memory usage,
      using color-coded points to represent different languages. The table complements this by listing detailed information, such as language type and average CPU load, which users can sort dynamically. Through brushing and linking, users can select data points on the scatterplot to highlight corresponding rows in the table,
      and vice versa, enabling synchronized and intuitive data exploration.</em></p>

    <h1>Data Analysis</h1>
    <p><em>Summary of data, data types, and data preprocessing.</em></p>

    <!--<p><em>Expectation: Data sources match the problem statement and are appropriate. These descriptions should be very explicit so someone could read your page and properly reproduce your results.</em></p>-->

    <p><em>The data used in the barchart and slider is in the <strong>programming_language_trends.csv</strong></em></p>
    <p><em>It include 4 types of data: date,category,value,color.
       each language has a specific color assigned to, and each language has corresponding data for the 12 months of each year. After organizing them, the data types are read to generate the visualization.</em></p>

    <p><em>The data for world map: <strong>programming_languages_popularity_by_region.csv.</strong></em></p>
    <p><em>It includes data on regions (category) and the percentage values for each programming language in those regions. The organized data is then read to generate the visualization.</em></p>
    <p><em>The data for Scatterplot and Table:<strong> Scatterplot_data.json.</strong></em></p>
    <p><em>The dataset consists of programming language performance metrics, including runtime, memory usage, source language, and average CPU load. Each record corresponds to a specific data point
      representing a programming language's performance characteristics.</em></p>

    <h1>Task Analysis</h1>

    <p><em><strong>Task1: Identify the most popular programming languages based on recent trends.</strong></em></p>

    <p><em>Task1: The bar chart clearly reflects the differences in popularity among different programming languages, as the bars are placed side by side, making it easy to compare their lengths. Additionally, the chart is already sorted, making the overall trend even clearer. Bar charts are also well-suited for handling categorical data, and this chart allows us to observe and analyze gradual trend changes over time by moving the time bar below the chart.

      By using encoding on categorized languages and date, the chart allows viewers to compare values effectively and complete the task1 well. And the selection feature of the table below allows viewers to better choose specific data to display, making it easier to compare and highlight the differences in data size for a smaller number of languages.
      </em></p>
    <p><em><strong>Task2: Compare performance of programming languages for different tasks.</strong></em></p>

    <p><em>Task2:The scatterplot visually represents relationships between runtime (x-axis) and memory usage (y-axis), with point sizes encoding average CPU load.
        The clear separation of points and their color-coded representation by language makes it intuitive to compare multiple languages at a glance. By selecting regions of interest using the brushing feature, users can isolate high-performing or outlier languages for specific tasks.
        The table complements the scatterplot by displaying detailed data, such as language type and other performance metrics, in a sortable format. Sorting and filtering features enable users to refine their analysis,
        focusing on relevant languages or metrics.</em></p>

    <p><em>The linking functionality between the scatterplot and table ensures synchronized updates—brushing a region in the scatterplot highlights corresponding rows in the table, and vice versa. This seamless interaction allows users to analyze specific subsets of languages,
        compare their performance, and identify the best options for different computational needs.
        The combination of scatterplot encoding and table interaction provides a powerful tool to evaluate trade-offs in runtime, memory usage, and CPU load,
        effectively addressing the task of comparing programming language performance across various scenarios.</em></p>
    <p><em><strong>Task3: Programming Languages Popularity by Region.</strong></em></p>
    <p><em>Task3: The processes involved in achieving the goal include browsing the map to select a country, then exploring the accompanying charts that dynamically update based on user selection. Additionally, hovering over a bar in the chart triggers a heatmap on the map, visually representing the popularity of the selected programming language across different regions. The abstract tasks supported by this visualization include comparison of language popularity across regions, exploration of trends within a specific country, discovery of regional differences that may not be immediately evident without the use of interactive visual tools, and analysis of language-specific global distributions.</em></p>


    <!--<p><em>Expectation: Clearly describes domain tasks, processes, goals and abstract tasks for domain problems.</em></p>-->

    <img src="/images/bar4.png" alt="barchartSketches" width="800" height="600">
    <p><em>The two images above show the earliest designs for the bar chart. However, due to time constraints and issues with data linkage at a later stage, we abandoned the feature of selecting and displaying only certain languages.</em></p>

    <img src="/images/scatter2.png" alt="scatterSketches" width="800" height="600">
    <img src="/images/scatter3.png" alt="scatterSketches" width="800" height="600">
    <p><em>The two images above shows the designs of scatter plot. In the initial design phase, I envisioned incorporating textual descriptions to highlight the unique features of each programming language directly within the visualization.
      However, due to time constraints and implementation complexity, I decided to prioritize enhancing the interactive and filtering capabilities of the charts. By focusing on features like brushing, dynamic linking, and sorting, users can now explore the data in a more intuitive and flexible way.
      This approach not only improves the usability of the scatterplot and table but also allows users to analyze performance metrics such as runtime, memory usage, and CPU load for specific programming languages in greater detail.</em></p>

    <img src="/images/map2.png" alt="mapSketches" width="600" height="600">
    <img src="/images/map1.png" alt="mapSketches" width="600" height="600">
    <p><em>During implementation, we discovered that the data we had didn't fit well with our initial pie chart design, so we opted for the second design, the map.</em></p>

    <!--<p><em>Expectation: Evidence of iterative improvement.
    Logical discussion of design choices grounded in theory from course.
    Discusses feedback from usability testing.</em></p>-->
